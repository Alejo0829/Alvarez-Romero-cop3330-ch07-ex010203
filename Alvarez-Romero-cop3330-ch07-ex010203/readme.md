User guide: This a very simple calculator, you can use it to solve basic math problems, if you would like to set a value to a certain variable please use this example, "Let a = x;"
With x being what ever value you would like. With every single line you write out, do not forget to add a ";" at the end for it to save properly. For the variables names, you
Can now save the variables with a _ with it. As an example "Let a_ = x;" you can do that aswell if needed. You can also add in constants that will not be changed during your 
Process. Some predetermined constants would be pi and e, where you would use the following "Let b = pi" and that would save properly. If you need to add custom varibles, then use
"Const name = x;" where name is whatever you want to call it and x is the set variable. Using the Let option is good since it save the values to different variables when needed. 
I hope you guys can use my simple calculator as intend and have a great day!
